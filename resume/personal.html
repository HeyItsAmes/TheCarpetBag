<h4>Personal Statement</h4>
I am a web developer and designer building an independent, freelance-focused practice with an emphasis on accessibility, usability, and real-world outcomes. I have experience with HTML and CSS, a working knowledge of ColdFusion, and I am currently expanding my skill set by deepening my JavaScript knowledge and pursuing additional coursework.</br>
My background includes both traditional workplace roles and freelance web and graphic design work, giving me a well-rounded perspective on business needs, collaboration, and independent problem-solving. Accessibility and usability are core to my development approach, not afterthoughts.</br>
What sets me apart is my commitment to understanding the people and goals behind each project. I approach development as a collaborative problem-solver, focused on improving workflows, user experience, and overall effectiveness. I am motivated by work that makes a meaningful difference, and I aim to deliver solutions that clients feel genuinely improved their outcomes.
